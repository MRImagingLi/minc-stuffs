Prerequisites:
--------------
In order to run vtk_meshconvert.py you need to have VTK installed. This can be done using (April 2015):
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install libvtk5-dev python-vtk
</pre></code>

Installing from github:
-----------------------
<pre><code>
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/minc-stuffs.git
</pre></code>
or
<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/minc-stuffs.git
cd minc-stuffs
git submodule update --init --recursive
</pre></code>

To build and install the perl and src code:
------------------------------------------
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

To build and install the python scripts:
---------------------------------------
python setup.py install

Installation Notes:
-------------------
1. If the minc2 libraries are not in your standard path, you will need to include --with-build-path=/path/with/minc-libraries when you run configure.
2. As is standard with configure files, the default installation is in /usr/local/. To install elsewhere, specify --prefix=DIR when you run configure.
3. The default python installation is also /usr/local/. To install elsewhere, specify --home=DIR or --prefix=DIR when running setup.py 

In the future, autogen and configure may be updated to automatically run python setup.py install.
