To build and install the perl and src code:
------------------------------------------
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

To build and install the python scripts:
---------------------------------------
python setup.py install

Installation Notes:
-------------------
1. If the minc2 libraries are not in your standard path, you will need to include --with-build-path=/path/with/minc-libraries when you run configure.
2. As is standard with configure files, the default installation is in /usr/local/. To install elsewhere, specify --prefix=DIR when you run configure.
3. The default python installation is also /usr/local/. To install elsewhere, specify --home=DIR or --prefix=DIR when running setup.py 

In the future, autogen and configure may be updated to automatically run python setup.py install.
